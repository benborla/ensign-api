## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This Rust Microservice Starter Kit is designed to provide a solid foundation for building high-performance, type-safe, and memory-safe microservices. It leverages the power of Rust along with modern frameworks and tools to ensure robust and efficient API development.

### Key Features:
- **Rust**: A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.
- **Axum**: A modular web framework that's built with Tokio, Tower, and Hyper.
- **Neon**: Serverless Postgres with a generous free tier. Neon separates storage and compute to offer autoscaling, branching, and bottomless storage.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Type Safety**: Leveraging Rust's strong type system to prevent runtime errors.
- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership model ensures memory safety without garbage collection.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
- Rust (latest stable version)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- WIP
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/benborla/rust-microservice-starter-kit.git
   cd rust-microservice-starter-kit
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

3. Set up the database
   ```
   # Create.env file via
   cp .env.dist .env
   
   # Run migrations
   cargo run --bin migrate
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.
